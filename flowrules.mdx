Flowrules are utilized in our DDoS analysis system to monitor incoming network traffic and respond appropriately to any detected anomalies. This feature enables the modification of DDoS filter activation behavior based on traffic pattern matching.

Customers can adjust the thresholds for various traffic types by matching flow samples with criteria such as protocol, port ranges, packet size, and TCP flags. Additionally, flowrules allow the initiation of specific actions for different traffic types, providing the ability to customize the DDoS detection process.
