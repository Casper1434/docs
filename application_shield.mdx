#### Application filters ####
Application filters can be established via both APIv1 and the Firewall Panel, allowing to configure game filters on spefic ports (ranges) with the option to set ratelimits, source IPs (range), source ports (ranges) and destination ports (ranges).

**The following (UDP) application filters are available and can be applied to any port (range):**

| Filter ID   | Game                           | 
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | 
| 0              | Disable entirely              | 
| 2203         | Multi Theft Auto - San Andreas| 
| 2324         | DayZ:SA / ArmA 3              | 
| 2629         | DTLS over UDP                 | 
| 2728         | Source Engine (Generic)       | 
| 2896         | SCUM                           | 
| 3032         | Cfx.re (FiveM / RedM)         |

| 7770         | Mordhau                        | 
| 7771         | alt:V Multiplayer              | 
| 7772         | San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP)| 
| 7773         | SCP: Secret Laboratory         | 
| 7774         | 7 Days to Die                  | 
| 9999         | TeamSpeak 3                    |
#### UDP Ratelimit ####
We've established precise rate limits for widely recognized UDP destination port ranges. Each source IP address is subject to a default rate limit of 120 packets per second (pps). However, these default limits can be overridden by custom-defined rate limits. It's essential to ensure that your service operates within the custom-defined default port range. For instance, maintaining stability for Source Engine Games requires operating within the port range of 27000-28000, as the default rate limit of 120pps may prove insufficient.
<Note>Applying application filters will overwrite standard UDP ratelimits.</Note>
