title: GRE Setup Network Bridge
description: 'This guides shows how to use Remote IPv4 IPs, tunnelled via GRE to your hypervisor and use the IPs on your VMs.'
---

### General Information ###
IP block we want to use on server B: `171.32.42.128/29`

Internal IP Block used for communication: `10.0.0.0/30`

Bridge interface server B: `br0`

### Server B ###
1. Setup the GRE tunnel on server B.
```
ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre local <IP server B> remote <IP server A> ttl 255
ip addr add 10.0.0.2/30 dev gre1
ip link set gre1 up
```
2. Enable IP forwarding. **[only execute once]**
```
sudo modprobe ip_gre
lsmod | grep gre
sudo apt install iptables iproute2
sudo echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

3. Route data from the GRE tunnel to the bridge and back.
```
ip route add default dev gre1 table 3
ip rule add from 171.32.42.128/29 table 3
ip route add 171.32.42.128/29 dev br0 table 3
ip addr add 171.32.42.128/29 dev br0 (If not already added to the bridge via netplan config)
```
You should be able to ping server A from server B.
```
Ping Server B
ping 10.0.0.2
```


To configure netplan, save configuration files under ```/etc/netplan/``` with a ```.yaml``` extension (e.g. ```/etc/netplan/config.yaml)```,
then run ```sudo netplan apply```. This command parses and applies the configuration to the system. Configuration written to disk under ```/etc/netplan/``` will persist between reboots.
Example file contents : ```/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml```

**Note:** _You will need the bridge-utils package installed on your server_

4. Add the following lines to the netplan file on the same level as "ethernets"
```
bridges:
  br0:
    addresses: ["171.32.42.129/29"]
```
Use the following network config in the adapter of your VM:
```
IP address: 191.80.60.130
Mask: 255.255.255.248 (depends on the subnet)
Gateway: 171.32.42.129
```
<Tip>We recommend setting the MTU of the bridge / VM network interface to **1476** as otherwise packet fragmentation may occur.</Tip>

That's it! Configure the network bridge and IPs in Virtfusion. On a server restart all the things we did will be wiped out. To make sure the GRE tunnel and everything else is going to work after a restart we have to edit the file ```/etc/rc.local``` and add all the commands we did (except for the echo ones!) before the ```exit 0```.
