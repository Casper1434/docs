Edge rules are firewall rules applied on our edge that can be established via both APIv1 and the Firewall Panel, allowing and denying traffic based on spefic requirements.

#### Key Points to Note: ####

Please read the below points carefully to understand how edge rules are configured properly.

- Edge rules can be formulated for individual IP prefixes (IPv4 /32) or entire subnets (IPv4 /24, for instance), employing the longest-prefix-match principle. Longest-Prefix-Match (LPM) entails that only rules corresponding to the longest prefix will be applicable. For instance, if rules for both /32 and /24 prefixes exist, only the /32 rules will be executed. In the absence of a rule for /32 but presence of one for /24, the /24 rules will be executed.
- Rules are executed prior to any other filtering logic, enabling the whitelisting, blacklisting of traffic, or configuration of subsequent filter logic.
- Edge rules are executed based on priority, where a priority of 1 indicates the highest precedence. This ensures that rules with lower priority numbers are processed after those with higher priority numbers, allowing for precise control over rule execution order.
