## Welcome

Welcome to the Rest API, we've documented all the API endpoints underneath, all the examples are written in json and can be performed in any language that is able to make http requests. We recommend tools like Insomnia or Postman to test the API.

## Authentication

You can authenticate to the API using your API key. The API key should be sent in the header of the request with the key: **x-api-key**.

```json
 "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key-here"
  }
```
