During active DDoS Mitigation, certain effects may be observed:

- Incoming DNS replies are restricted to specific IP addresses, including 1.1.1.1, 8.8.4.4, 8.8.8.8, and our internal DNS caches.
- ICMP traffic may undergo rate limiting, be discarded, or receive replies. Consequently, ICMP packet loss or increased latency could occur, albeit without impacting other protocols.
- TCP traffic mandates authentication, potentially resulting in connection resets during initial connection attempts.
- UDP traffic may experience rate limiting or require reconnection under specific conditions.
- It's important to note that ICMP traffic will be subject to rate limiting, replies, or discarding. Therefore, the stability of ICMP traffic should not be relied upon when DDoS-Filters are active. Any packet loss for ICMP or unusual behavior does not necessarily indicate a problem.

Should you encounter any other effects, please reach out to our customer support team. With our extensive logging and flow collection, we can typically investigate and address any reported anomalies.
<Note>Cloudflare or other CDNs may not work due to the TCP reset once mitigation is active. In case of issues with your CDN, please open a ticket.</Note>
